# Guessing Game
Hey there 👋🏿👋🏿

This is a simple bash script for a guessing game.  

## Game Overview
The guessing game is a simple game where the user has to guess a random number. The game starts by generating a random number between a specified range, usually between 1 and 100. 

The user then has to guess the number by inputting a number. The program then checks whether the number guessed by the user is the same as the randomly generated number. If the guess is correct, the game is over, and the program displays a message telling the user that they have won. 

If the guess is incorrect, the program provides a hint to the user, telling them whether their guess was too high or too low, and the user can guess again.
